# Advert Slot Section Added ✅

## Overview
I have added a new "Advert Slot" section to the homepage, inspired by Jumia's promotional banner layout. This section is placed right after the hero section to maximize visibility.

## 🎨 New Design Elements

### 1. **Promotional Banners (Generated Assets)**
I generated 3 high-quality, professional banners using Jumia's e-commerce aesthetic:
- **Genuine Spare Parts**: "Up to 30% Off" promotion.
- **Expert Car Servicing**: Promotion for booking trusted mechanics.
- **Verified Dealers**: Highlighting trusted car dealerships in Abuja.

### 2. **Jumia-Style Styling**
- **Ad-Slot Class**: Added a custom `.ad-slot` class in `style.css` with:
  - **Smooth Hover Transitions**: Slight lift and scale effects to make them feel interactive (just like Jumia).
  - **Premium Shadows**: Subtle shadows for a clean, modern look.
  - **Responsive Grid**: 3-column layout on desktop, stacking gracefully on mobile/tablet.
